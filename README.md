# WolfAndRabbit
Game
HOW TO PLAY
Instructions: 
Move character with the arrows; jump with SPACE
Avoid the enemy (wolf; if you collide with it, you lose 1 life, if your lives reach 0, you lose the game), collect as many cabbages as you can, and reach the door. You may pick up carrots to increase your health. You need at least 21 cabbages to pass level 3 and finish the game.
Extra feature is high-scoring: high scores are recorded and sorted; when you successfully finish the game, you will see a GUI with an option to type your name and save button to store your score.
Save/Load: I’m implementing game save/load on the whole game state. I can save and create my player while preserving his health and score. In addition, the position of all other bodies is also saved and can be loaded. Use key S to save and key R to load game.
Other features: In addition to high-scoring my game also contains enemy that moves on its own (FSM). In terms of coding, I’m making extensive use of packages and inheritance. I have paid close attention to respect naming conventions.
